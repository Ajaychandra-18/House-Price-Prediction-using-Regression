Linear Regression :  Linear Regression is a statistical model attempts to explain the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variable using a straight line.

The Aim of a linear regression is to find the best-fit line using a set of data points which can be used to make predictions about future observations.
The independent variable [X-axis] is also known as predictor variable and the dependent variable [Y-axis] is also known as output variable.
The Equation of simple linear regression is Y=mx+c.
